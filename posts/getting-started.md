# Getting your own blog up and running
## Why
I guess I should get started by saying that I learned a fair bit by reading what other people wrote on their personal
web pages.
- Reflecting on your own stuff
- Helping other people that have the same problems
- Scaffolding ideas
## How
There's a lot of Plug&Play solutions out there, where you can start typing right away. But for me, something always
feels off about them. Something I can't do how I want to, or simply that things are so much more complex than they have
to be. So naturally I wanted to create something from scratch.
### Setup
